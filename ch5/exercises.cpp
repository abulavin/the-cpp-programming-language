/**
 * If the initialiser to a const T& is not an lvalue of type T,
 * Casting to a const T& is done as follows:
 *  1. The variable being assigned is cast to type T, if needed.
 *  2. A temporary variable created by the compiler stores the 
 *     result of the cast.
 *  3. The temp variable is used to initialise the const reference.
 * This means we don't have to use an lvalue, or even the same type,
 * when initialising const references.
 * 
 * Note: A temporary created to hold a reference initializer persists 
 * until the end of its referenceâ€™s scope.
 * 
 * The reason references to vars and references to constants are 
 * treated differently is because storing a temp value for the var 
 * initialiser  poses the risk of assigning to the soon-to-dissappear
 * temp when assigning to the variable. This problem does not exist
 * when referencing constants because they cannot be changed after
 * initialisation.
